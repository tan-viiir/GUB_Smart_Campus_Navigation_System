Welcome to the Green University Smart Campus Navigation project! This C++ application is designed to help users navigate between buildings on the campus of Green University. It uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two buildings and DFS to verify building connectivity.

Features
Shortest Path Calculation: Finds the shortest path between two buildings using Dijkstra's algorithm.
Connectivity Check: Verifies if a path exists between two points on the campus map.
Interactive Console Application: Users are prompted to select starting and ending buildings, and the application provides navigation instructions.
